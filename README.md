# Potluck Planner

A simple web application that allows users to RSVP for a potluck, indicate what they will bring, and see who else is attending.

## Features

- Users can submit their name, whether they are attending, and what dish they will bring.
- The list of attendees is displayed on the page in real-time.
- Backend API built with Node.js and Express to store attendees in memory.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Tools**: Postman (for testing API endpoints)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potluck-planner.git
cd potluck-planner
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
node server.js
```

This starts the backend server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- Add a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store attendees persistently.
- Implement authentication for secure RSVP submissions.
- Add more customization features for the potluck (e.g., date, location, etc.).
